## Idea :page_with_curl:

Cave for devs is a project created for devs and students ready to learn, grow and share their knowledge. Thea main purpose of this repo is providing useful resources for:
1. improving your coding skills :technologist:
2. learning new things :student:
3. providing useful tutorials and material to learn and grow :books:
4. finding a lot of resources for practise various CS challenges and assignments for the university 
5. helping prepare for your interview

This is a brand new project and it has no resources at this point. I hope, with the help of community, we will create a real oasis, cave for devs. For developers, from developers :heart: :handshake:
